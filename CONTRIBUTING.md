# Contributing guidelines

Make sure to follow these guidelines before opening an [issue](https://github.com/Bellisario/bun-webextension/issues/new) or a [pull request](https://github.com/Bellisario/bun-webextension/pulls):

- An issue is for a bug or a feature request, if you have any question or something similar, please use [Discussions](https://github.com/Bellisario/bun-webextension/discussions).
- Before opening an issue of a pull request, please check if the issue or the pull request already exists.
- Before opening a pull request, make sure to run `bun run format` to keep the code formatted.
- Pull requests for packages updates are not allowed, Dependabot checks them automatically.
- If you don't know how to contribute you can always help others on [Discussions](https://github.com/Bellisario/bun-webextension/discussions), share your ideas with a new issue (feature request) or check the whole project for misspellings, too.
